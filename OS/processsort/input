Shape of my heart : Английский 

© Sting & Dominic Miller 

He deals the cards as a meditation 
And those he plays never suspect 
He doesn't play for the money he wins 
He don't play for respect 

He deals the cards to find the answer 
The sacred geometry of chance 
The hidden law of a probable outcome 
The numbers lead a dance 

Chorus: 
I know that the spades are the swords 
of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are weapons of war 

I know that diamonds mean money for 
this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart 

He may play the jack of diamonds 


He may lay the queen of spades 


He may conceal a king in his hand 
While the memory of it fades 







Chorus: 
I know that the spades are the swords 
of a soldier 
I know that the clubs are 
weapons of war 
I know that diamonds mean money 
for this art 
But that's not the shape of my heart 

(*)That's not the shape, the shape 
of my heart 

And if I told you that I loved you 
You'd maybe think there's 
something wrong 
I'm not a man of too many faces 
The mask I wear is one 

Well, those who speak know nothin' 
And find out to their cost 
Like those who curse their luck in too 
many places 
And those who fear are lost Shape of my heart : Английский
